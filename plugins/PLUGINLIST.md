Plug-in list
============

I want to keep a log of all plug-ins written for the `gulp-component-assembler` in one place. This is **your** place to advertise a plug-in you have created. If you want to add your plug-in to this list, please make a Pull-Request with your additions to this file.



## Plug-ins I supply

The source code for any plug-in that I write will be in the plugins folder of the `gulp-component-assembler` project.

I have written one plug-in to provide a different mechanism for loading template files. This is a feature that was needed by the FamilySearch team.

| Plug-in | Ver | Date | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fileNameProvider.js | 1.0.0 | 22 Nov, 2014 | A plug-in to provide the variable __FILE__ before each file from the `files` array is included in the assembly. Resolution for [Issue #2](https://github.com/intervalia/gulp-component-assembler/issues/2) | 
| oldTemplates.js | 1.0.0 | 13 Nov, 2014 | The `oldTemplates.js` plug-in allows the FamilySearch team to load a single template file called `template.html` from the assembly folder. It also uses a different mechanism for loading the templates into the JavaScript code. |
